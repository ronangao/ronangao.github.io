								I spent some time googling it but still have no idea whether there is going to be an eighth book of the Harry Potter novel, so this idea may not be newsworthy at all. But I could not let it go.
								<p class="para">
								Inspired by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gianordoli/sets/72157630201821428/" target="_blank">this project</a> done by Gabriel Gianordoli illustrating how colors changed through centuries of painting, I would like to create something about color and one of my favorites. My project would be an interactive chart that shows the use of color in each Harry Potter movie, which would hopefully give the viewers a sense of how the colors in the movies have been changing as the story goes. Additionally, several directors have been involved in the Harry Potter movies and each of them has a unique idea of art direction. By further examining their past works, I would try to demonstrate how the artistic tastes of each director affect the visual styles of eight different movies with similar characters, locations and stories.
								<p class="para">
								I have eight Harry Potter movies and that is all the data I need. 
								<p class="para">
								This project requires the knowledge of video editing and data analysis. I probably would need to learn how to get color information from each frame exported from the movie. The guy who made the painting piece said he used Processing which I believe is something I have to learn.</p>

							<div><h3>Reshaping the World</h3></div>
							
							<div><p class="para">

								To some Americans, all Asians look the same. To some Asians (like me), all Koreans (especially those on TV) look the same. The reason Iâ€™m interested in the artificial look of Korean TV stars is because right now in China, every teenage girl is talking about the same Korean TV drama called <i>My Love from Another Star</i> and the leading actor is one of the most popular celebrities in China. I have no idea why the girls, somehow, all have their own favorite male stars, since I still cannot tell the difference of their looks. The South Korea tops the world in plastic surgeons and procedures per capita and I wonder how the rest of the world is doing. The quest for beauty is universal. Yet the tastes can vary. 
								<p class="para">
								The project would be a (or several) chart(s) that shows the countries with top number of procedures and procedures per capita. This project would be interactive, allowing viewers to see the countries and types of surgeries they care about. Also I would like to bring the heat map onto a human body to illustrate which part of the body would most people want to change. 
								<p class="para">
								The <a href="http://www.isaps.org/en/" target="_blank"> International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery</a> provides such data as <a href="http://www.isaps.org/press-center/isaps-global-statistics" target="_blank"> International Survey on Aesthetic/Cosmetic Procedures Performed</a> in a particular year.
								<p class="para">
								For this project, I would need to learn skills that allow me to make a heat map on a human body. And the data analysis process requires some skills we have learnt in class.
